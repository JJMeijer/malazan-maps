I don't like auto-generated privacy policies which are purposefully vague & hard to understand. As an alternative let's just tell you which tools are gathering data, and also tell you why I use them.

- **Google App Engine Logging** - Malazan Maps is hosted on Google App Engine which provides request logs. These logs contain your IP address as well as your user-agent and are used in the case of 4xx/5xx errors to determine if something is wrong with the website. These logs are kept for 7 days before they are destroyed.
- **Cloudflare Web Analytics** - To have some indication of the amount of users that use Malazan Maps I've chosen to use <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Cloudflare Web analytics</a>.This is a privacy-first analytics solution that gathers its data through a web beacon image. This data is stored for 30 days before it's destroyed. The main reason why I chose this tool is that it's completely cookieless and because it has no affiliation with an ad provider.
