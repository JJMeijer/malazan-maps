    <p class="py-3">Auto-generated privacy policies are purposefully vague & hard to understand. As an alternative let's just tell you which tools are gathering data, and also tell you why they are used.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-outside pl-4">
        <li>
            <strong>Google App Engine Logging</strong> - Malazan Maps is hosted on Google App Engine which provides request logs. These logs contain your IP address as well as your user-agent and are used in the case of 4xx/5xx errors to determine if something is wrong with the website. These logs are kept for 7 days before they are destroyed.
        </li>
        <li class="pt-1">
            <strong>Cloudflare Web Analytics</strong> - To have some indication of the amount of users that use Malazan Maps I've chosen to use <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" class="underline hover:text-blue-500">Cloudflare Web analytics</a>.This is a privacy-first analytics solution that gathers its data through a web beacon image. This data is stored for 30 days before it's destroyed. The main reason why I chose this tool is that it's completely cookieless and because it has no affiliation with an ad provider.
